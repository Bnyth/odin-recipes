            <h2 class="white sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie;</li>
                <li>1 ½ pounds chicken;</li>
                <li>1 egg;</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white wine;</li>
                <li>⅛ cup dates, pitted and chopped;</li>
                <li>½ cup ground almonds;</li>
                <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese;</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt;</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper;</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper;</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves;</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger;</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground mace;</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon;</li>
                <li>1 cup chicken broth.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="white sub-title">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="white">
                <li>Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a saucepan, boil chicken with chicken broth, over low heat, for about 1 hour or until done. Add water, if necessary, to cover chicken while cooking. Drain and reserve the broth, and place cooked chicken in a large bowl;</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C);</li>
                <li>Add egg, white wine and 1 cup of chicken stock to the cooked chicken. Add dates, ground almonds and cheese, then toss to mix. Add salt, black and white pepper, cloves, ginger, mace and cinnamon. Mix spices in. Don't worry if the filling seems wet, it will thicken as it cooks;</li>
                <li>Pour filling into pie shell. Cover with top shell and crimp to seal edges;</li>
                <li>Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes to an hour.</li>
