            <p class="white">Remember when Kevin dropped his big pot of chili in The Office? Here's the recipe to make your own batch of "Kevin's Famous Chili."</p>
            <h2 class="white sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>3 ounces dried ancho chiles;</li>
                <li>1 ounce dried cascabel chiles;</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder;</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons cornmeal;</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon toasted & freshly ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>32 ounces chicken stock, divided;</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil;</li>
                <li>3 pounds chuck steak, trimmed and diced into very small cubes;</li>
                <li>1 large Spanish onion, chopped;</li>
                <li>2 jalapeños, seeded and chopped;</li>
                <li>1 habanero pepper (optional), seeded and chopped;</li>
                <li>4 large cloves garlic, crushed;</li>
                <li>12 ounces Mexican lager;</li>
                <li>6 roma tomatoes, cored and chopped;</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar;</li>
                <li>12 ounces can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained;</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper to taste.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="white sub-title">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="white">
                <li>According to Kevin, it's important to undercook the onions. He also stated he spent the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes, but that would be up to the cook's own discretion. The first step is to cut open the dried chilies and remove the seeds. The chilies will then need to be cut into small pieces before they are put in a dry pan over medium-high heat. Once the chilies are toasted, place them in a food processor until they are turned into a fine powder. Next, add cocoa powder, cornmeal, cumin, and oregano, and combine. Then add 3/4 cup of chicken stock and blend until it forms a paste. Set that mix of ingredients aside;</li>
                <li>In a large pot, not necessarily as large as Kevin's in The Office, pour in the vegetable oil and simmer over medium-high heat. Then add the beef in batches and once half of it is brown, add in the onion, jalapeños, habanero, and garlic. Let those ingredients simmer before deglazing with the Mexican beer. Next, add the tomatoes, brown sugar, kidney beans, beef, spice paste put together in the other bowl, and the rest of your chicken stock. Stir briefly and bring down the heat to allow the chili to simmer for two to three hours. Once the beef is tender and the chili is thickened, it will be ready to eat. Salt, pepper, cheese, or other garnished could be added depending on the eater's preference. Just keep it off of the office's carpeted floor because that's a clean-up you won't want to deal with.</li>
